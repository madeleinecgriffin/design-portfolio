        "Charcoal is often thought of as the bridge between drawing and painting, and it allowed me to express a great depth of subject using a 2D medium. Several of these portraits are from a class I took where I refined my technique by attempting to copy works drawn by masters of the craft. Several others are my own studies in light and shadow on the human form."

        "description": "I've always enjoyed strolling the streets of Chicago's many neighborhoods and admiring the old two and three flat homes. Each one I pass offers a glimpse into the many layers of architectural history of the neighborhood, and their intimacy to the street welcomes you to look at how each resident has made the home their own. This is a collection of 35mm film photographs of the different entryways, windowsills, and hidden gateways I've observed on my walks. These glimpses invite the viewer to imagine the individual that might live here and what their history might be, without showing a human subject. The medium of film is an old one that requires more manual work and individual input than new digital formats, which compliments the older buildings being photographed."

        "description": "The task of this project was to take a generic floor plan and disrupt and reorganize the space to create something new. I reconstructed an open floor office plan into a segmented art gallery. Gauzy curtains frame the art exhibitions and indicate a walking path, while a skylight puncturing the ceiling lets light disrupt the space and create a moment for quiet reflection."
